This is a challenge by Coodesh

Steps:

First step was setup the front-end/backend/database environment. I decided to use ReactJS, NodeJS with typescript, and PrismaORM to manage the interactions with the database which is POSTGRESQL. to run everything togheter I used Docker-compose, which allow to run the Front-end/Backend/database at the same time with only one command. I also assured that api is able to receive requisitions and add Data to the database.

Second step was to read the description of the application rules, gather the maximum amount of information that I could and organize the ideias of what I was reading and what I should do in each stack of the application (Front-end/Backend)
