This is a challenge by Coodesh

First step was setup the front-end/backend/database environment. I decided to use ReactJS, NodeJS with typescript, and PrismaORM to manage the interactions with the database which is POSTGRESQL. to run everything togheter I used Docker-compose, which allow to run the Front-end/Backend/database at the same time with only one command. I also assured that api is able to receive requisitions and add Data to the database.
